# GBT-EDGE

example scripts to reduce GBT EDGE data. Still very preliminary, expect updates.

# Installation

Install the following python packages in your whatever python3 environment you use:

* gbtpipe: https://github.com/GBTSpectroscopy/gbtpipe
* degas:   https://github.com/GBTSpectroscopy/degas

Probably better to use the source based install, so you can "git pull" while code updates are being made:

	  cd gbtpipe
      pip install -e .
	  
# Running

Since the weather info is nominally only available at GBO, you should run this on a GBO machine.
For those wishing to run this locally, consult the degas instructions
[here](https://github.com/GBTSpectroscopy/degas/blob/master/README.md#local-installation-of-the-degas-pipeline).
